You're given an HTML file that has a button and a div (that's a "division" in HTML, basically a place-holder where you can put content).

You're given some Javascript that contains code to find the div by ID and add a new paragraph to it.

Complete the code so that it does the following:

In the HTML:
- Put the word "Results" in the DIV
- Name the button "Enter game results", and have it call the Javascript function

In the Javascript function:
- Prompt the user to enter the names of two teams, and their scores in the game.
- Create a string that says which team won and by what score.
- If it's a tie, say so.
- Using the lines of Javascript provided, add that line to the div as a new paragraph.

Something to note! The script "Second.js" is in a separate file. In order for this to work, Second.html and Second.js have to be in the same directory. The HTML is loading the Javascript.
